                python package statistic


    ~ What is Dclnt?

      Dclnt is a library for obtaining words using statistic in python modules,
      based on ast syntax trees and nltk semantic taggers.
      It's intended for getting started very quickly
      and was developed with best intentions in mind.

    ~ Is it ready?

      It's still not 1.0 but it's shaping up nicely and is
      already widely used.  Consider the API to slightly
      improve over time but we don't plan on breaking it.

    ~ What do I need?

      You can see all dependencies in 'requirements.txt'.
      Check the docs for complete installation and usage instructions.

    ~ Where are the docs?

      We have no docs yet :)

    ~ Where are the tests?

      Tests? What tests?

    ~ Where can I get help?

      Nobody can help you...
